/**
 * Compute an \p n x \p m pixel hashing table usable as slice, subslice or
 * pixel pipe hashing table.  The resulting table is the cyclic repetition of
 * a fixed pattern with periodicity equal to \p period.
 *
 * If \p index is specified to be equal to \p period, a 2-way hashing table
 * will be generated such that indices 0 and 1 are returned for the following
 * fractions of entries respectively:
 *
 *   p_0 = ceil(period / 2) / period
 *   p_1 = floor(period / 2) / period
 *
 * If \p index is even and less than \p period, a 3-way hashing table will be
 * generated such that indices 0, 1 and 2 are returned for the following
 * fractions of entries:
 *
 *   p_0 = (ceil(period / 2) - 1) / period
 *   p_1 = floor(period / 2) / period
 *   p_2 = 1 / period
 *
 * The equations above apply if \p flip is equal to 0, if it is equal to 1 p_0
 * and p_1 will be swapped for the result.  Note that in the context of pixel
 * pipe hashing this can be always 0 on Gfx12 platforms, since the hardware
 * transparently remaps logical indices found on the table to physical pixel
 * pipe indices from the highest to lowest EU count.
